Introduction
The rules that govern piloting an aircraft by seeing and avoiding hazards are called visual flight rules (VFR). If meteorological conditions, primarily clouds, don’t allow safe visual avoidance, pilots must use instruments to navigate following instrument flight rules.
To fly under VFR, you must be able to fly the aircraft with the following cloud clearance and visibility:
•	If below clouds, at least 500 below the cloud ceiling
•	If above clouds, at least 1000 feet above the clouds
•	Horizontal separation from clouds of at least 2000 feet
•	Visibility of at least 3 statute miles
If the above conditions cannot be met, you may not fly following visual flight rules. I attempted to make an app that, given cloud separation distances and visibility, would return a simple statement of either “VFR conditions are met” or “VFR conditions are NOT met”. I’ll save you the trouble of testing this, it doesn’t work. I was not able to get and use the data entered on the user input form.

Dependency Injection
I think my service implementation is complete and registered correctly. In the Services folder, I have an interface that is applied to a public class, VFRWxService.
Separation of Concerns
As my program grew in size and complexity, I really saw the benefit of separation of concerns. I was getting lost trying to find previously written code and, as I wrote new code, I spent more time thinking about where to put it. I also started putting more thought into choosing good, descriptive names. 

Unit Testing
I was not able to accomplish unit testing. I like to think I could eventually figure it out, but I have approximately 25 hour in on this assignment, it's already being submitted late, and I have to get started on this week's assignment.

Thank you.
